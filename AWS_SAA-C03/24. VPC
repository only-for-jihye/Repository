VPC - Virtual Private Cloud 

1. CIDR 
    "Classless Inter-Domain Routing" - a method for allocating IP addresses 
    Used in "Security Groups" rules and AWS networking in general 
    They help to define an IP address range :
        We've seen WW.XX.YY.ZZ/32  => one IP 
        We've seen 0.0.0.0/0  => all IPs
        But we can define : 192.168.0.0/26  => 192.168.0.0 ~ 192.168.0.63  (64 IP addresses)

    Understanding CIDR
        IPv4 
            A CIDR consists of two components
            - Base IP 
                Represents an IP contained in the range (XX.XX.XX.XX)
                Example : 10.0.0.0, 192.68.0.0, ... 
            - Subnet Mask 
                Define how many bits can change in the IP 
                Example : /0, /24, /32 
                Can take two forms :
                    /8   <->  255.0.0.0
                    /16  <->  255.255.0.0
                    /24  <->  255.255.255.0
                    /32  <->  255.255.255.255
        Subnet Mask 
            The Subnet Mask basically allows part of the underlying IP to get additional next values from the base IP 
            192.168.0.0    /32   =>  allows for   1 IP (2^0)        -> 192.168.0.0
            192.168.0.0    /31   =>  allows for   2 IP (2^1)        -> 192.168.0.0 ~ 196.168.0.1
            192.168.0.0    /30   =>  allows for   4 IP (2^2)        -> 192.168.0.0 ~ 196.168.0.3
            192.168.0.0    /29   =>  allows for   8 IP (2^3)        -> 192.168.0.0 ~ 196.168.0.6
            192.168.0.0    /28   =>  allows for  16 IP (2^4)        -> 192.168.0.0 ~ 196.168.0.15
            192.168.0.0    /27   =>  allows for  32 IP (2^5)        -> 192.168.0.0 ~ 196.168.0.31
            192.168.0.0    /26   =>  allows for  64 IP (2^6)        -> 192.168.0.0 ~ 196.168.0.63
            192.168.0.0    /25   =>  allows for 128 IP (2^7)        -> 192.168.0.0 ~ 196.168.0.127
            192.168.0.0    /24   =>  allows for 256 IP (2^8)        -> 192.168.0.0 ~ 196.168.0.255
            ...
            192.168.0.0    /16   =>  allows for 65536 IP (2^16)     -> 192.168.0.0 ~ 196.168.255.255
            ...
            192.168.0.0    /0    =>  allows for All IPs             -> 0.0.0.0 ~ 255.255.255.255
            * Quick Memo 
                Octets 
                    ______.______.______.______
                      1st    2nd    3rd    4th
                    /32  - no octet can change 
                    /24  - last octet can change 
                    /16  - last 2 octets can change 
                    /8   - last 3 octets can change 
                    /0   - all octets can change
            * Little Exercise 
                192.168.0.0/24   =>   192.168.0.0 ~ 192.168.0.255 (256 IPs)
                192.168.0.0/16   =>   192.168.0.0 ~ 192.168.255.255 (65,536 IPs)
                134.56.78.123/32 =>   Just 132.56.78.123
                0.0.0.0          =>   All IPs 
        
    Public  vs.  Private IP  (IPv4)
        The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) established certain blocks of IPv4 addresses for the use of private (LAN) and public (Internet) addresses 
        "Private IP" can only allow certain values :
            10.0.0.0 ~ 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8) <- in big networks 
            172.16.0.0 ~ 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12) <- "AWS default VPC in that range"
            192.168.0.0 ~ 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16) <- e.g., home networks 
        All the rest of the IP addresses on the Internet are Public 
    

2. Default VPC Walkthrough
    All new AWS accounts have a default VPC 
    New EC2 instances are launched into the default VPC if no subnet is specified 
    Default VPC has Internet connectivity and all EC2 instances inside it have public IPv4 addresses 
    We also get a public and a private IPv4 DNS names 


3. VPC in AWS - IPv4 
    VPC = Virtual Private Cloud 
    You can have multiple VPCs in an AWS region (max. 5 per region - soft limit)
    Max. CIDR per VPC is 5, for each CIDR :
        Min. size is /28  (16 IP addresses)
        Max. size is /16  (65536 IP addresses)
    Because VPC is private, only the Private IPv4 ranges are allowed 
        10.0.0.0     ~  10.255.255.255  (10.0.0.0/8)
        172.16.0.0   ~  172.31.255.255  (172.16.0.0/12)
        192.168.0.0  ~ 192.168.255.255  (192.168.0.0/16)
    Your VPC CIDR should NOT overlap with your other networks (e.g., corporate)


4. VPC - Subnet (IPv4)
    AWS reserves "5 IP addresses (first 4 & last 1)" in each subnet 
    These 5 IP addresses are not available for use and can't be assigned to an EC2 instance 
    Example : if CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, then reserved IP addresses are :
        10.0.0.0  - Network Address 
        10.0.0.1  - reserved by AWS for the VPC router
        10.0.0.2  - reserved by AWS for mapping to Amazon-provided DNS 
        10.0.0.3  - reserved by AWS for future use 
        10.0.0.255 - Network Broadcast Address. AWS does not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore the address is reserved 
    * Exam Tip : if you need 29 IP addresses for EC2 instance :
        You can't choose a subnet of size /27 (32 IP addresses, 32 - 5 = 27 < 29)
        You need to choose a subnet of size /26 (64 IP addresses, 64 - 5 = 59 > 29)


5. Internet Gateway (IGW)
    Allows resources (e.g., EC2 instacnes) in a VPC connect to the Internet 
    It scales horizontally and is highly available and redundant 
    Must be created separately from a VPC 
    One VPC can only be attached to one IGW and vice versa 
    Internet Gateways on their own do not allow Internet access ...
    *Route tables must also be edited 


6. Bastion Hosts 
    We can use a Bastion Host to SSH into our private EC2 instances 
    The bastion is in the public subnet which is then connected to all other private subnets 
    "Bastion Host security group must allow" inbound from the internet on port 22 from restricted CIDR, for example the "public CIDR" of your corporation
    "Security Group of the EC2 Instances" must allow the Security Group of the Bastion Host, or the "private IP" of the Bastion host 


7. NAT Instance ("outdated", but still at the exam)
    "NAT = Network Address Translation"
    Allows EC2 instances in private subnets to connect to the Internet 
    Must be launched in a public subnet 
    Must disable EC2 setting : "Source / destination Check"
    Must have Elastic IP attached to it 
    Route Tables must be configured to route traffic from private subnets to the NAT Instance 

    NAT Instance - Comments 
        Pre-configured Amazon Linux AMI is available
            Reached the end of standard support on December 31, 2020
        Not highly available / resilient setup out of the box
            You need to create an ASG in multi-AZ + resilient user-data script 
        Internet traffic bandwidth depends on EC2 instance type 
        You must manage Security Groups & rules :
            Inbound :
                Allow HTTP / HTTPS traffic coming from Private Subnets 
                Allow SSH from your home network (access is provided through Internet Gateway)
            Outbound :
                Allow HTTP / HTTPS traffic to the Internet 


8. NAT Gateway 
    AWS-managed NAT, higher bandwidth, high availability, no administration
    Pay per hour for usage and bandwidth 
    NATGW is created in a specific Availability Zone, uses an Elastic IP 
    Can't be used by EC2 instance in the same subnet (only from other subnets)
    Requires an IGW (Private Subnet => NATGW => IGW)
    5 Gbps of bandwidth with automatic scaling up to 45 Gbps 
    No Security Groups to manage / required 

    NAT Gateway with High Availability
        "NAT Gateway is resilient within a single Availability Zone"
        Must create "multiple NAT Gateways in multiple AZs" for fault-tolerance 
        There is no cross-AZ failover needed because if an AZ goes down it doesn't need NAT 

    NAT Gateway  vs.  NAT Instance 
                                NAT Gateway                                             NAT Instance
        Availability            Highly available within AZ (create in another AZ)       Use a script to manage failover between instances 
        Bandwidth               Up to 45 Gbps                                           Depends on EC2 instance type 
        Maintenance             Managed by AWS                                          Managed by you (e.g., software, OS patches, ...)
        Cost                    Per hour & amount of data transferred                   Per hour, EC2 instance type and size, + network $
