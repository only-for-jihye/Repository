1. Lambda, SNS & SQS 
    SQS + Lambda 
    SQS FIFO + Lambda 
    SNS + Lambda 

    Fan Out Pattern : deliver to multiple SQS 
        Option 1 : SDK --PUT #1--> SQS #1
                       --PUT #2--> SQS #2
                       --PUT #3--> SQS #3
        Option 2 : SDK -> SNS --Subscribe--> SQS #1
                              --Subscribe--> SQS #2
                              --Subscribe--> SQS #3

    S3 Event Notifications 
        S3:ObjectCreated, S3:ObjectRemoved, S3:ObjectRestore, S3:Replication, ...
        Object name filtering possible (*.jpg)
        Use case : generate thumbnails of images uploaded to S3 
        "Can create as many 'S3 events' as desired 
        S3 event notifications typically deliver events in seconds but can sometimes take a minute or longer 
        * events -> Amazon S3 -> SNS, SQS, Lambda Function 

    S3 Event Notifications with Amazon EventBridge 
        * --events-->  Amazon S3 bucket  --All events-->  Amazon EventBridge  --rules-->  Over 18 AWS services as destinations 
        "Advanced filtering" options with JSON rules (metadata, object size, name, ...)
        "Multiple Destinations" : ex. Step Functions, Kinesis Streams / Firehose, ...
        "EventBridge Capabilities" : Archive, Replay Events, Reliable delivery 

    Amazon EventBridge - Intercept API Calls 
        User  --DeleteTable API Call-->  DynamoDB  --Log API call-->  CloudTrail (any API call)  --event-->  Amazon EventBridge  --alert-->  SNS 

    API Gateway - AWS Service Integration - Kinesis Data Streams example 
        Client  --requests-->  API Gateway  --send-->  Kinesis Data Streams  --records-->  Kinesis Data Firehose  --store .json files-->  Amazon S3 


2. AWS Caching Strategies 
    CloudFront, API Gateway, Redis/Memcached/DAX, RDS 
    CloudFront(Edge), S3


3. Blocking an IP address 
    NACL, Security Group, Firewall 

    with an ALB 
        ALB Security Groups    EC2 Security Group 
        ALB Security Groups과 NACL로 제어

    with an NLB 
        NLB는 Security Group이 없음, 따라서 NACL로 제어

    ALB + WAF 
        ALB에 WAF를 설치하여 IP address filtering 제어 ...

    ALB + CloudFront, WAF 
        Client 바로 뒤에.. CloudFront를 설치하여 제어
        CloudFront는 Geo Restriction 가능
        WAF를 CloudFront에 설치하여 IP address filtering 추가 
        NACL는 이 구조에서는 도움이 되지 않음


4. High Performance Computing (HPC)        
    The cloud is the perfect place to perform HPC 
    You can create a very high number of resources in no time 
    You can speed up time to results by adding more resources 
    You can pay only for the systems you have used 
    Perform genomics, computational chemistry, financial risk modeling, weather prediction, machine learning, deep learning, autonomous driving 
    Which services help perform HPC ?

    Data Management & Transfer 
        AWS Direct Connect :
            Move GB/s of data to the cloud, over a private secure network 
        Snowball & Snowmobile :
            Move PB of data to the cloud 
        AWS DataSync :
            Move large amount of data between on-premise and S3, EFS, FSx for Windows 

    Compute and Networking 
        EC2 Instances :
            CPU optimized, GPU optimized 
            Spot Instances / Spot Fleets for cost savings + Auto Scaling 
        EC2 Placement Groups : Cluster for good network performance 
            Same Rack + Same AZ  =>  Placement Group, Cluster, Low latency, 10Gbps network 

        EC2 Enhanced Networking (SR-IOV)
            Higher bandwidth, higher PPS (packet per second), lower latency 
            Option 1 : "Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)" up to 100 Gbps 
            Option 2 : Intel 82599 VF up to 10 Gbps - LEGACY 
        
        Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
            Improved ENA for "HPC", only works for "Linux" 
            Great for inter-node communications, "tightly coupled workloads"
            Leverages Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard 
            Bypasses the underlying Linux OS to provide low-latency, reliable transport 

    Storage 
        Instance-attached storage :
            EBS : scale up to 256,000 IOPS with io2 Block Express 
            Instance Store : scale to millions of IOPS, linked to EC2 instance, low latency 
        Network Storage :
            Amazon S3 : large blob, not a file system 
            Amazon EFS : scale IOPS based on total size, or use provisoned IOPS 
            Amazon FSx for Lustre :
                HPC optimized distributed file system, millions of IOPS 
                Backed by S3 

    Automation and Orchestration
        AWS Batch 
            AWS Batch supports multi-node parallel jobs, which enables you to run single jobs that span multiple EC2 instances 
            Easily schedule jobs and launch EC2 instances accordingly
        AWS ParallelCluster
            Open-source cluster management tool to deploy HPC on AWS 
            Configure with text files 
            Automate creation of VPC, subnet, cluster type and instance types 
            "Ability to enable EFA on the cluster (improves network performance)"


5. EC2 Instances High Availablity
    Creating a highly available EC2 instance 
    Creating a highly available EC2 instance with an Auto Scaling Group 
    Creating a highly available EC2 instance with ASG + EBS
