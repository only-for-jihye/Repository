AWS Integration & Messaging
    SQS, SNS & Kinesis

    Section Introduction
        When we start deploying multiple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with one another
        There are two patterns of application communication
        1) Synchronous communications (application to application)
            Buying Service  <--------->  Shipping Service 
        2) Asynchronous / Event based (application tot queue to application)
            Buying Service --> Queue --> Shipping Service 
        Synchronous between applications can be problematic if there are sudden spikes of traffic 
        What if you need to suddenly encode 1000 videos but usually it's 10 ?
        In that case, it's better to decouple your applications,
            using SQS : queue model 
            using SNS : pub/sub model 
            using Kinesis : real-time streaming model 
        There services can scale independently from our application !


1. Amazon SQS 
    What's a queue ?
        Producer 1  ----Send messages---->              ----Poll messages----> Consumer 1
        Producer 2  ----Send messages---->  SQS Queue   ----Poll messages----> Consumer 2
        Producer 3  ----Send messages---->              ----Poll messages----> Consumer 3

    Amazon SQS - Standard Queue
        Oldest offering (over 10 years old)
        Fully managed service, used to decouple applications 
        Attributes :
            Unlimited throughput, unlimited number of messages in queue 
            Default retention of messages : 4 days, maximum of 14 days 
            Low latency (less 10 ms on publish and receive)
            Limitation of 256 KB per message sent 
        Can have duplicate messages (at least once delivery, occasionally) -> poll 처리 후, 해당 message를 delete하지 않으면 그 다음 poll에 다시 가져오기 때문, delete를 해야 SQS Queue에 정상적으로 처리 되었다고 알려줄 수 있음
        Can have out of order messages (best effort ordering)
    
    SQS - Producing Messages 
        Produced to SQS using the SDK (SendMessage API)
        The message is persisted in SQS until a consumer deletes it 
        Message retention : default 4 days, up to 14 days 
        Example : send an order to be processed 
            Order id 
            Customer id 
            Any attributes you want 
        SQS standard : unlimited throughput 
    
    SQS - Consuming Messages 
        Consumers (running on EC2 instances, servers, or AWS Lambda ...)
        Poll SQS for messages (receive up to 10 messages at a time)
        Process the messages (example : insert the message into an RDS database)
        Delete the messages using the DeleteMessage API 
    
    SQS - Multiple EC2 Instances Consumers 
        Consumers receive and process messages in parallel
        At least once delivery 
        Best-effort message ordering 
        Consumers delete messages after processing them 
        We can scale consumers horizontally to improve throughput of processing 
    
    SQS with Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
        SQS Queue ----Poll for messages----> EC2 instances ASG       <----scale----
        -> Cloud Watch Metric - Queue Length ----Alarm for breach----> CloudWatch Alarm
           (ApproximateNumberOfMessages)

    SQS to decouple between application tiers 
        requests -> Front-end web app ----SendMessage----> SQS Queue ----ReceiveMessages----> Back-end processing Application ----insert----> Repository
                    Auto-Scaling                                                              Auto-Scaling

        SSE-KMS 
        SSE-C 


    SQS - Message Visibility Timeout 
        After a message is polled by a consumer, it becomes invisible to other customers 
        By default, the "message visibility timeout" is 30 seconds 
        That means the message has 30 seconds to be processed 
        If a message is not processed within the visibility timeout, it will be processed twice 
        A consumer could call the "ChangeMessageVisibility" API to get more time 
        If visibility timeout is high (hours), and consumer crashes, re-processing will take time 
        If visibility timeout is too low (seconds), we may get duplicates 
        2번 처리되지 않도록 하려면 Application에서 적절하게 ChangeMessageVisibility API를 호출하도록 설계해야 한다.

    Amazon SQS - Long Polling 
        When a consumer requests messages from the queue, it can optionally "wait" for messages to arrive if there are non in the queue 
        This is called Long Polling 
        Long Polling decrease the number of API calls made to SQS while increasing the efficiency and latency of your application 
        The wait time can be between 1 sec to 20 sec (20 sec preferable)
        Long Polling is preferable to Short Polling 
        Long Polling can be enabled at the queue level or at the API level using WaitTimeSeconds

    Amazon SQS - FIFO Queue 
        FIFO = First In First Out (ordering of messages in the queue)
        Limited throughput : 300 msg/s without batching, 3000 msg/s with 
        Exactly-once send capability (by removing duplicates) ***
        Messages are processed in order by the consumer 
    
    SQS with Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
        If the load is too big, some transactions may be lost ...
        Solution : using SQS as a buffer to database writes 
        requests -> Enqueue message (EC2 instances, Auto-Scaling) ----SendMessage----> SQS Queue (infinitely scalable) ----ReceiveMessages----> Dequeue message(EC2 instances, Auto-Scaling) ----insert----> RDS ~

    **** SQS는 자주 출제되므로 필히 기억할 것


2. Amazon SNS 
    What if you want to send one message to many receivers ?
        Direct integration 
            Buying Service -> Email notification
                           -> Fraud Service
                           -> Shipping Service
                           -> SQS Queue 
        Pub / Sub (Publish / Subscribe)
            Buying Service --> SNS Topic --> Email notification 
                                         --> Fraud Service 
                                         --> Shipping Service 
                                         --> SQS Queue 
    
    The "event producer" only sends message to one SNS topic 
    As many "event receivers" (subscriptions) as we want to listen to the SNS topic notifications 
    Each subscriber to the topic will get all the messages (note : new feature to filter messages)
    Up to 12,500,000 subscriptions per topic
    100,000 topic limit 
    SNS ----publish----> Subscribers (SQS, Lambda, Kinesis Data Firehose, Emails, SMS & Mobile Notifications, HTTP(S) Endpoints)

    SNS intergates with a lot of AWS services 
        Many AWS services can send data directly to SNS for notifications
        CloudWatch Alarms, AWS Budgets, Lambda, ASG(Nofitications), S3 Bucket(Events), DynamoDB, CloudFormation(State Changes),
            AWS DMS(New Replic), RDS Events .... ----publish----> SNS

    AWS SNS - How to publish 
        Topic Publish (using the SDK)
            Create a topic 
            Create a subscription (or many)
            Publish to the topic 
        Direct Publish (for mobile apps SDK)
            Create a platform application 
            Create a platform endpoint 
            Publish to the platform endpoint 
            Works with Google GCM, Apple APNS, Amazon ADM ...
    
    Amazon SNS - Security 
        Encryption :
            In-flight encryption using HTTPS API 
            At-rest encryption using KMS Keys 
            Client-side encryption if the client wants to perform encryption / decryption itself 
        Access Controls : IAM policies to regulate access to the SNS API 
        SNS Access Policies (similar to S3 bucket policies)
            Useful for cross-account access to SNS topics 
            Useful for allowing other services (S3...) to write to an SNS topic
