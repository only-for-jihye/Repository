1. EC2
    EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS's offering
    EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
    It mainly consists in the capability of :
        Renting virtual machines (EC2)
        Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
        Distributing load across machines (ELB)
        Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
    Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works


2. EC2 sizing & configuration options
    Operating System (OS) : Linux, Windows or MAC OS
    How much compute power & cores (CPU)
    How much random-access memory (RAM)
    How much storage space:
        Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
        hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
    Network card : speed of the card, Public IP address
    Firewall rules : security group**
    Bootstrap script (configure at first launch) : EC2 User Data 
        -> EC2 User Data
            It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script 
            bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts 
            That script is only run once at the instance first start 
            EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as :
                Installing updates
                Installing sofrware 
                Downloading common files from the internet 
                Anything you can thing of ..
            The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user (sudo ~)

3. EC2 Instance Types - Overview
    You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimised for different use cases (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types)
    AWS has the following naming convention :
        m5.2xlarge
        -> m : instance class (m? : usually instance)
        -> 5 : generation (AWS improves them over time)
        -> 2xlarge : size within the instance class (more cpu, memory) small, large, xlarge, 2xlarge ~

    EC2 Instance Types - General Purpose
        Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
        Balance between : 
            Compute
            Memory
            Networking
        Mac, T4g, T3, T3a, T2, M6g, M5, M5a, M5n, M5zn, M4, A1 ~

    EC2 Instance Types - Compute Optimized
        Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors :
            Batch processing workloads 
            Media transcoding
            High performance web servers 
            High performance computing (HPC)
            Scientific modeling & machine learning
            Dedicatged gaming servers 
        C6g, C6gn, C5, C5a, C5n, C4
    
    EC2 Instance Types - Memory Optimized
        Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory 
        Use cases :
            High performance, relational/non-relational databases 
            Distributed web scale cache stores 
            In-memory databases optimized for BI (Business Intelligence)
            Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data
        R6g, R5, R5a, R5n, R4, X1e, X1, High Memory, z1d    (R- RAM)
    
    EC2 Instance Types - Storage Purpose
        Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage 
        Use cases :
            High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems 
            Relational & NoSQL databases 
            Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
            Data warehousing application 
            Distributed file systems 
        I3, I3en, D2, D3, D3en, H1
