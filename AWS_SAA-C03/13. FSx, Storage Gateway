7. Storage Gateway 
    Hybrid Cloud for Storage 
        AWS is pushing for "hybrid cloud"
            Part of your infrastructure is one the cloud
            Part of your infrastructure is on-premises 
        This can be due to
            Long cloud migrations
            Security requirements 
            Compliance requirements
            IT strategy
        S3 is a proprietary storage technology (unlike EFS / NFS), so how do you expose the S3 data on-premises?
            AWS Storage Gateway 
    
    AWS Storage Cloud Native Options 
        Block  : Amazon EBS, EC2 Instance Store 
        File   : Amazon EFS, Amazon FSx 
        Object : Amazon S3, Amazon Glacier 
    
    AWS Storage Gateway 
        Bridge between on-premises data and cloud data 
        Use cases :
            disaster recovery 
            backup & restore 
            tiered storage 
            on-premises cache & low-latency files access 
        Types of Storage Gateway :
            S3 File Gateway
            FSx File Gateway
            Volume Gateway
            Tape Gateway
    

8. Amazon S3 File Gateway
    Configured S3 buckets are accessible using the NFS and SMB protocol
    Most recently used data is cached in the file gateway 
    Supports S3 Standard, S3 Standard IA, S3 One Zone A, S3 Intelligent Tiering
    Transition to S3 Glacier using a Lifecycle Policy 
    Bucket access using IAM roles for each File Gateway 
    SMB Protocol has integration with Active Directory (AD) for user authentication

    Native access to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server 
    Local cache for frequently accessed data 
    Windows native compatibility (SMB, NTFS, Active Directory ...)
    Use for group file shares and home directories


10. Volume Gateway 
    Block storage using iSCSI protocol backed by S3 
    Backed by EBS snapshots which can help restore on-premises volumes 
    Cached volumes : low latency access to most recent data 
    Stored volumes : entire dataset is on premise, scheduled backups to S3 


11. Tape Gateway 
    Some companies have backup processes using physical tapes 
    With Tape Gateway, companies use the same processes but, in the cloud 
    Virtual Tape Library (VTL) backed by Amazon S3 and Glacier 
    Back up data using existing tape-based processes (and iSCSI interface)
    Works with leading backup software vendors 


12. Storage Gateway - Hardware appliance 
    Using Storage Gateway means you need on-premises virtualization
    Otherwise, you can use a Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance 
    You can buy it on amazon.com 
    Works with File Gateway, Volume Gateway, Tape Gateway 
    Has the required CPU, memory, network, SSD cache resources 
    Helpful for daily NFS backups in small data centers

    Pay per provisioned endpoint per hour + data transfers in GB 
    Store and manage users' credentials within the service 
    Integrate with existing authentication systems (Microsoft Active Directory, LDAP, Okta, Amazon Cognito, custom)
    Usage : sharing files, public datasets, CRM, ERP, ...


14. AWS DataSync 
    Move large amount of data to and from 
        On-premises / other cloud to AWS (NFS, SMB, HDFS, S3 API ...) - needs agent**
        AWS to AWS (different storage services) - no agent needed**
    Can synchronize to :
        Amazon S3 (any storage classes - including Glacier)
        Amazon EFS 
        Amazon FSx (Windows, Lustre, NetApp, OpenZFS, ...)
    Replication tasks can be scheduled hourly, daily, weekly
    * File permissions and metadata are preserved (NFS POSIX, SMB ...)
    One agent task can use 10 Gbps, can setup a bandwidth limit
    ***** AWS DataSync를 사용하고자 하지만 네트워크가 문제가 될 수 있다. 이 때 AWS Snowcone (agent pre-installed)을 사용하면 된다.


15. Storage Comparison 
    S3 : Object Storage
