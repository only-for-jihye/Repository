1. Amazon RDS Overview 
    RDS stands for Relational Database Service 
    It's a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language
    It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS 
        * Postgre
        * MySQL
        * MariaDB
        * Oracle
        * Microsoft SQL Server 
        Aurora (AWS Proprietary databse)


2. Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2 
    RDS is a managed service :
        Automated provisioning OS patching 
        Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
        Monitoring dashboards 
        Read replicas for improved read performance 
        Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
        Maintenance windows for upgrades
        Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
        Stroage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
    But you can't SSH into your instances 


3. RDS - Stroage Auto Scaling 
    Helps you increase stroage on your RDS DB instance dynamically
    When RDS detects you are running out of free database stroage, it scales automatically
    Avoid manually scaling your database stroage 
    You have to set Maximum Storage Threshold (maximum limit for DB stroage)
    Automatically modify stroage if :
        Free stroage is less than 10% of allocated storage 
        Low-storage lasts at least 5 minutes 
        6 hours have passed since last modification 
    Useful for applications with unpredictable workloads 
    Supports all RDS database engines (MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle)


4. RDS Read Replicas for read scalability
    Up to 15 Read Replicas 
    Within AZ, Cross AZ or Cross Region 
    Replication is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent
    Replicas can be promoted to their own DB 
    Applications must update the connection string to leverage read replicas 


5. RDS Read Replicas - Use Cases 
    You have a production database taht is taking on normal load 
    You want to run a reporting application to run some analytics 
    You create a Read Replica to run the new workload there 
    The production application is unaffected 
    Read replicas are used for SELECT(=read) only kind of statements (not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

    *** Network Cost
        In AWS there's a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another 
        For RDS Read Replicas within the same region, you don't pay that fee 
            Same Region / Different AZ 
                us-east-1a / us-east-1b
                    Same Region : Free 
            Different Region / AZ 
                us-east-1a / eu-west-1b 
                    Cross-Region : $$$
