Deploying and Managing Infrastructure at Scale Section

1. CloudFormation
    CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported)
    For example, within a CloudFormation template, you say :
        I want a security group 
        I want two EC2 instances using this security group 
        I want an S3 bucket 
        I want a load balancer (ELB) in front of these machines 
    Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the "right order", with the "exact configuration" that you specify 

    Benefits of AWS CloudFormation
        Infrastructure as code 
            No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control 
            Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code 
        Cost 
            Each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack costs you 
            You can estimate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template 
            Savings strategy : In Dev, you could automation deletion of templates at 5 PM and recreated at 8 AM, safely
        Productivity
            Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly 
            Automated generation of Diagram for your templates 
            Declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering and orchestration)
        Don't re-invent the wheel 
            Leverage existing templates on the web 
            Leverage the documentation
        Supports (almost) all AWS resources :
            Everything we'll see in this course is supported 
            You can use "custom resources" for resources that are not supported 

    CloudFormation Stack Designer 
        Example : WordPress CloudFormation Stack 
        We can see all the resources 
        We can see the relations between the components
