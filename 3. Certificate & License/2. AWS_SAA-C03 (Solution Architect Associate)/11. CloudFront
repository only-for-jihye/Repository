1. AWS CloudFront
    Content Delivery Network (CDN)
    Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge 
    Improves users experience (low latency)
    216 Point of Presence globally (edge locations)
    DDoS protection (because worldwide), integration with Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall


2. CloudFront - Origins 
    S3 bucket 
        For distributing files and caching them at the edge 
        Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)
        OAC is replacing Origin Access Identity (OAI)
        CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)
    Custom Origin (HTTP)
        Application Load Balancer 
        EC2 instance 
        S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website)
        Any HTTP backend you want 
    S3 as an Origin 
        CloudFront & Edge Location을 이용해 특정 리전에 속한 S3 bucket을 전 세계로 분산시킬 수 있다.


3. CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication (CRR)
    CloudFront 
        Global Edge network 
        Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
        Great for static content that must be available everywhere 
    S3 Cross Region Replication 
        Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen 
        Files are updated in near real-time 
        Read only 
        Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions 


4. CloudFront - ALB or EC2 as an origin 
    Users -> Edge Location <---------------------------------> Security group (EC2 Instances)
                            Allow Public IP of Edge Locations                  "Must be public"
    
    users -> Edge Location <---------------------------------> Security group (Application Load Balancer)  <------------------------------------> Security group (EC2 Instance)
                            Allow Public IP of Edge Locations                  "Must be public"             Allow Security Group of Load Balancer           "Can be private"
                                      Public Ips


5. CloudFront Geo Restriction
    you can restrict who can access your distribution 
        Allowlist : Allow your users to access your content only if they're in one of the countires on a list of approved countries
        Blocklist : Prevent your users from accessing your content if they're in one of the countries on a list of banned countries 
    The "country" is determined using a 3rd party Geo-IP database 
    Use case : Copyright Laws to control access to content 


6. CloudFront - Pricing 
    CloudFront Edge locations are all around the world 
    The cost of data out per edge location varies 

    Price Classes 
        You can reduce the number of edge locations for cost reduction 
        Three price classes :
            1. Price Class All : all regions - best performance 
            2. Price Class 200 : most regions, but excludes the most expensive regions 
            3. Price Class 100 : only the least expensive regions - 북미, 유럽 한정 ...


7. CloudFront - Cache Invalidations 
    In case you update the back-end origin, CloudFront doesn't know about it and will only get the refreshed content after the TTL has expired 
    However, you can force an entire or partial cache refresh (thus bypassing the TTL) by performing a CloudFront Invalidation 
    You can invalidate all files (*) or a special path (/images/*)


8. Global Accelerator
    Global users for our application 
        You have deployed an application and have global users who want to access it directly 
        They go over the public internet, which can add a lot of latency due to many hops (router~)
        We whish to go as fast as possible through AWS network to minimize latency 
    Unicast IP vs Anycast IP 
        Unicast IP : one server holds one IP address 
        Anycast IP : all servers hold the same IP address and the client is routed to the nearest one 

    * AWS Global Accelerator (using Anycast IP)
        Leverage the AWS internal network to route to your application 
        2 Anycast IP are created for your application 
        The Anycast IP send traffic driectly to Edge Locations 
        The Edge locations send the traffic to your application 
        using Edge location, Private AWS, ...

        Works with Elastic IP, EC2 instances, ALB, NLB, public or private 
        Consistent Performance
            Intelligent routing to lowest latency and fast regional failover 
            No issue with client cache (because the IP doesn't change)
            Internal AWS network 
        Health Checks 
            Global Accelerator performs a health check of your applications 
            Helps make your application global (failover less than 1 minute for unhealthy)
            Great for disaster recovery (thanks to the health checks)
        Security 
            only 2 external IP need to be whitelisted 
            DDoS protection thanks to AWS Shield 

    * AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront 
        Same 
            They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world 
            Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection 
        Different 
            CloudFront 
                Improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos)
                Dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery)
                Content is served at the edge 
            Global Accelerator 
                Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP 
                Proxing packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS regions 
                Good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP 
                Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses 
                Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover
