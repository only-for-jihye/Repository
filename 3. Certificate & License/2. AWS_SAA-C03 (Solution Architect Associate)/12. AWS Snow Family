1. AWS Snow Family 
    Highly-secure, portable devices to collect and process data at the edge, and migrate data into and out of AWS 
    Data migraion :
        Snowcone, Snowball Edge, Snowmobile
    Edge computing :
        Snowcone, Snowball Edge 
    

2. Data Migrations with AWS Snow Family 
    Challenges :
        Limited connectivity 
        Limited bandwidth 
        High network cost 
        Shared bandwidth (can't maximize the line)
        Connection stability 
    AWS Snow Family : offline devices to perform data migrations 
        If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices!

            -> 네트워크가 아닌 물리적 경로를 사용
    

3. Snowball Edge (for data transfers)
    Physical data transport solution : move TBs or PBs of data in or out of AWS 
    Alternative to moving data over the network (and paying network fees)
    Pay per data transfer job 
    Provide block stroage and Amazon S3-compatible object storage 
    Snowball Edge Storage Optimized 
        80 TB of HDD capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage 
    Snowball Edge Compute Optimized 
        42 TB of HDD or 28 TB NVMe capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage 
    Use cases : large data cloud migrations, DC decommission, disaster recovery 


4. AWS Snowcone & Snowcone SSD 
    Small, portable computing, anywhere, rugged & secure, withstands harsh environments 
    Light (4.5 pounds, 2.1 kg)
    Device used for edge computing, storage, and data transfer 
    Snowcone - 8 TB of HDD Storage 
    Snowcone SSD - 14 TB of SSD Storage 
    Use Snowcone where Snowball does not fit (space-constrained environment)
    Must provide your own battery / cables 
    Can be sent back to AWS offline, or connect it to internet and use AWS DataSync to send data 


5. AWS Snowmobile 
    Transfer exabytes of data (1 EB = 1,000 PB = 1,000,000 TBs)
    Each Snowmobile has 100 PB of capacity (use multiple in parallel)
    High security : temperature controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance 
    Better than Snowball if you transfer more than 10 PB 


6. AWS Snow Family for Data Migrations 
                            Snowcone                            Snowball Edge                           Snowmobile 
                            Snowcone & Snowcone SSD             Snowball Edge Storage Optimized         Snowmobile
    Storage Capacity        8 TB HDD, 14 TB SSD                 80 TB Usable                            < 100 PB
    Migration Size          Up to 24 TB, online and offline     Up to petabytes, offline                UP to exabytes, offline 
    DataSync agent          Per-installed 

    Show Family - Usage Process 
        1. Request Snowball devices from the AWS console for delivery 
        2. Install the snowball client / AWS OpsHub on your servers 
        3. Connect the snowball to your servers and copy files using the client 
        4. Ship back the device when you're done (goes to the right AWS facility)
        5. Data will be loaded into an S3 bucket 
        6. Snowball is completely wiped


7. Edge Computing ?
    Process data while it's being created on an edge location 
                                                -> A truck on the road, a ship on the sea, a mining station underground ...
    These locations may have 
        Limited / no internet access 
        Limited / no easy access to computing power 
    We setup a Snowball Edge / Snowcone device to do edge computing 
    Use cases of Edge Computing :
        Preprocess data 
        Machine learning at the edge 
        Transcoding media streams 
    Eventually (if need be) we can ship back the device to AWS (for transferring data for example)

    Snow Family - Edge Computing 
        Snowcone & Snowcone SSD (smaller)
            2 CPUs, 4 GB of memory, wired or wireless access 
            USB-C power using a cord or the optional battery 
        Snowball Edge - Compute Optimized 
            104 vCPUs, 416 GiB of RAM 
            Optional GPU (userful for video processing or machine learning)
            28 TB NVMe or 42 TB HDD usable storage 
            Storage Clustering available (up to 16 nodes)
        Snowball Edge - Storage Optimized 
            Up to 40 vCPUs, 80 GiB of RAM, 80 TB storage 
        All : Can run EC2 Instances & AWS Lambda functions (using AWS IoT Greengrass)
        Long-term deployment options: 1 and 3 years discounted pricing 


8. AWS OpsHub 
    Historically, to use Snow Family devices, you needed a CLI (Command Line Interface tool)
    Today, you can use AWS OpsHub (a software you install on your computer / laptop) to manage your Snow Family Device 
        Unlocking and configuring single or clustered devices 
        Transferring files 
        Launching and managing instances running on Snow Family Devices 
        Monitor device metrics (storage capacity, active instances on your device)
        Launch compatible AWS services on your devices (ex: Amazon EC2 instances, AWS DataSync, Network File Sytstem(NFS))


9. Solution Architecture : Snowball into Glacier 
    Snowball cannot import to Glacier directly 
    You must use Amazon S3 first, in combination with an S3 lifecycle policy 
        Snowball  ----import----> Amazon S3 ----S3 lifecycle policy----> Amazon Glacier
